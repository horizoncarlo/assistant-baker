Byron, Watson and Holmes are about to leave for the Playhouse, where violin vir-tuoso Alfredo Fetuchinni is going to perform. It is well known that Holmes is a violin buff, so Playhouse director Sir Charles Higgenbottom has asked Holmes to play a duet finale with Fetuchinni.
While Byron, Watson and Holmes are waiting for their carriage, Inspector Lestrade rushes up with ominous news. The Chameleon, a master of disguise, has escaped prison. It was Holmes who originally captured the Chameleon; and the criminal swore vengeance on this, the first anniversary of his capture.
Fearing for his friend's life, Watson attempts to prevent Holmes from going to the concert. But the detective is adamant.
At the Playhouse, Madam Clara Leslie, a wealthy patron of the arts, presents Holmes with a potted geranium. Carriage driver Jerome Magnuson tells the party he'll return to pick them up after the concert.
Watson attends to the WC and returns with a sudden case of laryngitis, blaming it on his nervousness concerning the Chameleon. Sir Charles Higgenbottom personally greets Holmes' party to show them to their balcony seats; and Holmes notices that Sir Charles is extraordinarily pale.

Harmon was slumped over his Edwardian style desk, surrounded by a roomful of assorted pawned items such as a riding saddle; a cobbler's bench; a complete set of Old English armour; a handmade wooden battleship; an old handcarved Hotel sign; a collection of Dutch pottery; and an array of musical instruments, clocks and watches.
On the desk top next to Harmon was an envelope addressed to one Harry Blake, in care of a prison in Switzerland.
An investigation by Scotland Yard has revealed that Rafer Harmon was actually Rudolph Hickel, a petty thief wanted by authorities for his involvement in a number of burglary capers. Hickel dropped out of sight a few years ago after double-crossing a band of fellow thieves involved in a London Museum jewel heist.
Hickel disappeared with the two most valuable items of the heist-the famous matching Eyes of Lucifer pearls, worth over fifty thousand pounds apiece. His partners, and Scotland Yard, have been searching for Hickel ever since.
The envelope on Hickel's desk contained a note apparently written in code. Scotland Yard believes that Hickel knew he was dying and penned this note, intending to send it to his old friend Harry Blake, who is due to be released from prison in two weeks.
The coded note reads as follows: XQZMZBDCHRMHRKQZDO
Unable to crack the code, Scotland Yard has come to Sherlock Holmes for assistance. Scotland wants Holmes to a) translate the coded message.

When she returned around 10:00 a.m., Miss Frawley found Ostermann slumped over his desk atop a pile of scattered papers. He
had been hit on the right side of the head with a blunt object.
The lock on Mr. Ostermann's file cabinet was broken, and it appeared that some papers had been removed from the files.
Miss Frawley says that when she left for the Playhouse, Mr. Ostermann was alone in his office.

The papers relate that three persons-a maid, a butler and Sir Arthur Thomson himself-were murdered; and the famous Thomson diamond, one of the largest in the world, was stolen from the wall safe in the Thomson mansion.
The only clues were a silver-rimmed monocle found near Sir Arthur's body, and a series of footprints found in the red mud outside the mansion's large bay window.
Sir Hyman Pearson, a wealthy jewel collector and friendly rival of the late Sir Arthur Thomson, has come to 221 B Baker Street with the following incredible account.
According to Sir Hyman, three nights ago-the night of the Thomson jewel robbery he went to dinner as usual at his club below the Hotel. There he met an elderly gentleman who introduced himself as Mr. Jonathan Hackett. The two men conversed, and Mr. Hackett invited Sir Hyman to join him for dinner and a game of backgammon.
Sir Hyman's memory then goes blank; and the next thing he remembers is waking in his bedroom the following morning, still dressed in his dinner clothes. At the time, he noticed that his shoes were caked with red mud, and his expensive silver-rimmed monocle was missing.
Just this morning, Sir Hyman received a small, unmarked package delivered by a carriage driver. Upon opening the package, Sir Hyman found the famous Thomson diamond, wrapped in a note.
The scribbled note instructed Sir Hyman to go to the amusement arcade in the Park and view the moving pictures in the kinetoscope there.
Confused, Sir Hyman followed these instructions. Looking through the peep-hole of the kinetoscope, Sir Hyman was shocked to find himself watching what appeared to be a filmed account of the murders and jewel robbery at the Thomson mansion-and the murderer and thief in the pictures appeared to be Sir Hyman himself!
Panic stricken and afraid to go to the police, Sir Hyman has come to 221 B Baker Street to seek help.
After hearing Sir Hyman's story, Dr. Watson readily admits that this is perhaps the most puzzling case that he and his partner in deduction have ever faced. Indeed, Wat-son wonders if even the great Sherlock Holmes will be able to figure out a) how this diabolical scheme was carried out, b) who is behind it, and c) the motive.
The game is afoot!`, numAnswers: 3, solution: `The notorious Professor Moriarty concocted this fiendish scheme as a way to acquire both the famous Thomson diamond and the Ziegfield necklace.
Moriarty arranged for his associate in crime, Colonel Sebastian Moran, to pose as an elderly gentleman (Jonathan Hackett) and meet Sir Hyman Pearson at the dinner club.
With a clever use of backgammon pieces, Colonel Moran managed to hypnotize Sir Hyman, and the latter was brought to the scene of the crime at the Thomson mansion.
Knowing that even under hypnosis Sir Hyman would not actually kill anyone. Moriarty arranged for his own minions to murder the three persons at the Thomson mansion, and then Moriarty had pictures taken, which he used in the kinetoscope, of Sir Hyman standing over the dead bodies.
Moriarty hoped to use these pictures as a means of blackmail to extort compliance from Sir Hyman. Knowing that Scotland Yard's intensive security at the Museum's exhibit this weekend would make it extremely difficult for an outsider to get close to the Ziegfield necklace, Moriarty hoped to force Sir Hyman to steal the Ziegfield necklace for him. How Carried Out: Hypnotism; Who Is Behind It: Moriarty; Motive: To obtain both the Thomson diamond and the Ziegfield necklace.`,

Philomena Pettibone's dog act is performing at the Playhouse. Organ grinder Mario Morelli is getting drunk at the Pub, ranting about the economy and how he can't make enough money to feed his monkey. Tiny Hoggins, an unemployed jockey, is angered by Mario's complaining and a fight ensues.
At the same time, deep in a high security vault beneath the Bank, an engraver is making his annual inspection of the printing plates for all of England's currency.
After forty-five minutes has elapsed, the Bank's head secuirty officer, Colin Battersea, opens the locked vault to find the engraver dead and the plates gone. The grating to the air shaft has been removed, but the shaft itself is far too narrow for a normal man to enter. And the engraver certainly would have heard anyone who tried to remove the grating while he was checking the plates.
The coroner believes the victim was poisoned, but he cannot discover how the poison was administered. The prime minister himself calls Sherlock Holmes into the case; for if the counterfeiters begin flooding the market with authentic notes, Britain's economy will surely collapse!
The Government wants Holmes to find out a) who killed the engraver, b) the weapon used to kill him, c) how the plates were removed from the vault, d) where the stolen plates are hidden, and e) the mastermind behind the plot.

Subkow, Skottle and Jones, Ltd., was found dead in the alley behind the Newspaper Shop. He had been shot in the head. The wespon, a small gun, was in Skottle's hand; and a suicide note, explaining that he no longer desired to live, was in Skottle's pocket.
There was beer on Skottle's breath; and near his body were found a half-smoked Turkish cigar, a little yellow pill, and a small key.
Earlier that day, Skottle had lunch with his four business partners at a special business luncheon in their office next to the Bank. Skottle's partners-George Netter. Arthur Kendrick, J.S. Subkow and Thomas Jones-all noticed that Skottle seemed unusually depressed during their meeting. Skottle's partners all knew of what they called Skottle's "suicidal tendencies;" and they all knew that Skottle had once attempted to hang himself years ago. The partners recalled that Skottle was the first to leave the meeting Saturday, and he said he was going to stop by the Pub before going home.
Scotland Yard has determined Skottle's death to be an obvious case of suicide. But the dead man's wife, Mrs. Esther Skottle, is unconvinced. She has come to 221 B Baker Street to ask Sherlock Holmes to check into her husband's death.
Mrs. Scottie admits that her husband had been concerned about some business issues recently; but she insists that her husband's moods of depression and thoughts of suicide were all in the past.
Mrs. Skottle suspects foul play; and she wants Holmes to find out a) who killed her husband, and b) the motive.

William Skottle decided this was not going to help the firm in the end, and he tried to convince his partners to come clean and accept the consequences.
When it became evident that Skottle was going to expose their charade, Skottle's four partners formulated a plan to kill him and make it look like suicide.
At their Saturday gathering, Skottle's partners forced him to write a suicide note, shot him in Thomas Jones' office, poured beer on his mouth to make it appear that he had been drinking; and moved his body via carriage to the alley behind the Newspaper Shop.

He was a scalawag and a prankster who never pass-ed up an opportunity to embarrass someone through a practical joke. It was Tom who invented the joy buzzer and the whoopee cushion; and some even credit him with having originated the fake vomit.
It was well known that Tom's favorite target was his old headmaster, Stanley Bosworth, who was the victim of some of the most elaborate pranks Tom ever con-ceived. Tom's eventual marriage to Bosworth's daughter, Melissa, was considered by many to be Tom's ultimate joke on the respected headmaster.
Among the more prominent victims of Tom Dayton's past pranks were Judge Walter Brighton; Lord and Lady Morton of Westchester; banker Mortimer Fawcett, Doctor Fabian Peerpoint; and tobacco merchant Dawes Flescher.
All of the above were present at the dinner party held on the Bosworth yacht in honor of Stanley Bosworth's 60th birthday. Also included among the guests were Holmes and Watson, and Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard.
Following an uneventful dinner, most of the guests retired to their staterooms to freshen up. Suddenly a shot rang out. Then another. All aboard the yacht, including the yacht's captain, Jonas Fenton, and cook, Mildred Weekson, arrived at Tom Dayton's stateroom to find him dead-shot in the forehead.
A smoking revolver lay near the doorway; and Tom Dayton's body lay on the floor across the room, just below an open porthole. Scrawled in the dust near Dayton's body were the initials SB.
Learning that the revolver belonged to Stanley Bosworth, Lestrade promptly ordered the headmaster arrested for the murder of Tom Dayton.
Lestrade, quite pleased, later remarks to Holmes that he wishes the solution to every case were this simple.
"That is precisely what troubles me, Inspector," replies Holmes. "It is too simple."
Holmes expresses his opinion that Lestrade has yet to find out a) who killed Tom Dayton, and b) the motive.
The game is afoot!`, numAnswers: 2, solution: `Knowing he had only a short time to live, Tom Dayton decided to play the ultimate practical joke on his old headmaster. Tom killed himself and framed Stanley Bosworth
Here is how he did it First, he opened the porthole. Then he scrawled the initials SB in the dust on the floor below the porthole. Then he took Bosworth's revolver, which he had secretly taken from his father-in-law's home, and fired a shot out through the porthole and into the water.
He then tossed Bosworth's warm gun towards the door across the room, and he held another revolver, his own, out through the porthole and, pointing the gun back at himself, shot himself in the head. As he dropped to the floor dead, Tom's gun fell from his hand and into the water outside. Killer: Tom Dayton; Motive: Practical joke`,

        no: 16, title: 'THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUDGEONING BOBBY', details: `Three strangely similar murders, one each night, have occurred in London during the past three nights. In each case, the victim was a large, well-built man in his early twen-ties. Each victim had been bludgeoned to death-hit over the head with a blunt object. Each had apparently been killed in the early morning hours around dawn. Each body was found in or near the Park. Each victim had fresh black mud under his fingernails. And perhaps the oddest similarity of all is the fact that each of the three victims was seen in the custody of a bobby the night of his death.
The three victims were Barney Grantweather, a Locksmith apprentice; William Beck, a bellhop at the Hotel; and Maclain Forrester, a dockworker.
Both Grantweather and Beck, on separate nights, were seen as they were stopped by a bobby and apparently arrested outside the Pub. Forrester was last seen talking with a bobby outside the Playhouse. In each instance, witnesses were able to identify the bobby only as a man of medium height, medium build, and around forty years of
age. The bobbies currently on night duty in the general area of the Pub and the Playhouse are Barnaby Hawkins, Ross Caruthers, and Ainsley Deacon. But all of these men are well under forty; and none of them professes to have seen the victims before the murders.
Scotland Yard, extremely concerned about the possible involvement of a bobby in this shocking series of murders, is desperate to find the killer before a public panic sets in.
Inspector Lestrade, pressured by his superiors for a swift solution to the murders. has come to 221 B Baker Street to review the facts with the master sleuth. Lestrade wants to discover a) who killed the three men, b) the weapons used, and c) the motive.

Once at Scotland Yard, Moran led the victims to the cellar of the bungalow behind Scotland Yard, where he provided them with a shovel and forced them at gunpoint to work all night digging a tunnel to the Bank. At dawn, Moran used the shovel to bludgeon his victims to death and he then transported their bodies to the Park.
At the rate of one man per night, Moran had hoped to finish his tunnel in time to reach the Bank vault when the special gold shipment arrived later in the month. Killer: Colonel Moran; Weapon: Shovel; Motive: Tunnel to Bank.`,

Standing before the fireplace, the two Scotland Yard detectives wait until they are sufficiently thawed out before they finally speak.
Addressing Holmes and Watson, Gregson relates the circumstances surrounding the curious incident of the tobacco clerk, Manfred Maloney, who was found stabbed to death in the Tobacconist shop this morning. Near the dead man's body were a pud-dle of water and a rolled up newspaper. The forefinger of Maloney's right hand was smeared with blood, and the word ERIN was scrawled in blood on the cigar case above his body.
Gregson believes that if they can just find a woman named Erin who knew Maloney, they can solve the mystery. Gregson's assistant, however, has suggested that the word ERIN is a code word of the Erse Kernes, a secret revolutionary group active in Ireland during that country's last struggle with Britain; and he believes that Maloney's death was some sort of revenge killing.
Gregson asks Holmes which of the two theories the Baker Street sleuth thinks cor-rect; but Holmes expresses his wish to visit the scene of the crime before embracing any theories.
At the Tobacconist shop, Holmes notices that the area behind the main counter is in disarray, as if someone had been frantically searching for something. And above the back shelf, next to a photograph of Maloney himself smoking a pipe, is a large hang-ing calendar. Penciled into the calendar block containing today's date are the initials "D.H." and the time "9:00 a.m."
"Did you find a weapon?" Watson asks the Scotland Yard detectives.
"No," replies Gregson.
"Do you have any witnesses or suspects?" asks Watson.
"None," says Gregson. "The body was found this morning by carriage driver Daniel Hardy, who stopped in the shop to purchase some pipe tobacco."
"Indeed," remarks Inspector Cooke, "this is a very complex case. It seems too much to hope that we will ever find the solution."
"Not so, Inspector," offers a confident Holmes. "Quite often, the more complex a case appears on the surface, the simpler is the actual solution."

The late Colonel's lawyer, James Pushkin, has wired Sherlock Holmes and asked him to accompany Miss Startforth to the Dock today to meet Mr. Athelney Barlow, a courier from India, who will deliver the Colonel's valuables to Miss Startforth.
Upon reaching the Dock, Holmes and Miss Startforth find Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard already there and the courier bludgeoned to death on the foredeck of the Calcutta Queen, a tramp steamer.
Matthew Bedford, the steamer's first mate, and Bosun Andrew Jamison state that when they last spotted Barlow, the courier was carrying a large valise and a heavy walking stick. Jamison notes that a monkey wrench is missing from a work site on the foredeck.
All that is found on the dead man's person is a stamped but unmailed letter ad-dressed to Sherlock Holmes and a pocketful of loose change.
Holmes opens the letter, which simply reads: "If you are reading this, Mr. Holmes, foul play has occurred. Do not relinquish your search, for a great fortune is at hand."
Captain of the steamer, Hugh Prescott, agrees to remain in port until the crime is solved. Holmes pockets the letter and returns with Miss Startforth to Baker Street to reflect on the circumstances of this curious case.
Later, Inspector Lestrade arrives with Bosun Jamison in tow. The Inspector holds up a gold-capped walking stick and announces triumphantly, "You may relax, Holmes. We have the killer and the weapon. We found the courier's walking stick un-der the Bosun's bunk."

Finding nothing of value on Barlow, Prescott disgustedly threw the valise overboard and decided to frame Andrew Jamison by planting the walking stick under Jamison's bunk.

Scotland Yard has established through a witness that only three persons entered or left the Apothecary during the time of the murder.
The witness, Mrs. Wilma Farr, who lives two doors from the Apothecary, stated: "I was sitting outside on my porch waiting for my mail like I always do, when Mr. Kane came by returning from lunch. He stopped for a moment and we chatted. I remember he said he had eaten lunch at the Pub with Mr. Daniel Kirwin, an official at the Museum. Then he said 'Ta ta,' and he went and reopened the Apothecary for business."
Mrs. Farr states that she then observed only three persons enter or leave the Apothecary. These three were Myra Hyatt, a teller at the Bank; Ciara Wexler, a Playhouse actress, and Michael Milligan, the neighborhood bobby on beat. All three of these unlikely suspects admit entering the Apothecary shortly after lunch; but all three claim to have left the druggist in good health.
Mrs. Farr says that after the postman arrived, she read through her mail and found a letter addressed to Mr. Kane which was left with her by mistake. She decided to take the letter to Mr. Kane; and upon arriving at the Apothecary, she found the dead druggist's body and called the police.

Dunphy was married to Miss Leslie Scott Rutherford, a wealthy heiress whose late father founded Rutherford Candlemakers, one of the largest beeswax and candlemaking companies in England.
Dunphy, ten years younger then Leslie Rutherford, met and married the woman three years ago. Since that time, the couple has lived as the only residents of Miss Rutherford's (now Mrs. Dunphy's) modest country estate in Wessex.
According to Mrs. Dunphy, she last saw her husband three nights ago when he went outside to check on a noise which seemed to come from the tool shed in the back of their house. Suspecting that there might be a prowler on the grounds, Mr. Dunphy took a lighted candle and went outside to check.
A few minutes later, the tool shed was aflame; and before help could be sum-moned, the shed burned to the ground. Mr. Dunphy's remains, burned beyond recognition, were found in the charred rubble of the shed.
The simple explanation for Dunphy's death is that Dunphy surprised a prowler in the tool shed; the prowler knocked Dunphy unconscious and fled; and the lit candle dropped to the ground and set the shed on fire.
But Gregson has a feeling that there's more to the case than that. He says he can't put his finger on it; but, for some reason he feels that Mrs. Dunphy is hiding something.
Holmes and Watson agree to accompany Gregson to Wessex to view the scene of
the crime and talk to Mrs. Dunphy. But first Holmes insists that they stop at the Bank. At the Dunphy home, Holmes spots a wheelbarrow standing near a back wall and notices deep wheelbarrow impressions leading from the house to the tool shed. Among the tool shed ashes, Holmes finds a large hunk of green beeswax.
While talking to Mrs. Dunphy in her study, Holmes holds up the beeswax and asks the woman if it is from the candle her husband carried outside three nights ago. Holmes tosses the wax to Mrs. Dunphy. She clasps her legs together, catching the wax in her lap, and then examines it. "Yes," she says, "it definitely appears to be from the same candle."
Holmes says, "I thought as much." Then the master detective turns to a surprised Gregson and Watson and announces that he has solved the case. Holmes offers to reveal a) the killer, b) the weapon, and c) the motive.
